My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
It was increadibly hard to build a code like this, where everything works like I wondered. I understand how works it, but I need more time to build a site what is on my level becuase this is just the basics.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
How we can write codes more clearer and easier. I tried to clean my code, to look clean and easy to readn, but I feel that it is still messy.
