My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
I'm proud of how we've worked together this week. Felt nice that we had most of the Javascript
part in place and basic design early in the week.

I think the structure of the JS-file feels good and I hope the code is easy to read.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
I would have liked to create a function that takes search city and return with timezone that city shall have
and use the timezone value in the `Date()` object.
