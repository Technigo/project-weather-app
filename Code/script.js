 /* Feature: Sunrise and sunset
 Show the time for sunrise and sunset in a readable time format (Example: 13:00 or 1 PM).
 You will have to format the date from milliseconds to a readable format. */












 /* Feature: Weather forecast
 Show a forecast for the next 5 days.
 You can choose how to display the forecast - perhaps you want to show the min and max temperature for each day,
 or perhaps you want to show the temperature from the middle of the day, or the humidity, what it feels like and so on. */
