# Weather App

This was the fifth project on the Technigo boot camp. The assignment was to create a weather app that shows todays weather and a five day forecast, fetching the data from an open weather API.

## The problem

This week I, again, tried to focus on getting the logic in place before starting on the design. I tried different approaches to get the data into the HTML, and settled on creating an empty HTML skeleton before populating it by using a forEach loop. I found it much easier to get all my flexboxes right when I had something to look at in the HTML file.

I used flexboxes galore. In hindsight I would hade tried to set up grids instead, because this didn't seem like a very efficient solution.

Last week I tried to move as much of tha javascript as possible into separate functions and then call the functions inside of the main functions. This week I tried a different approach and left the code that somehow related to the function instead of creating a new function. I suppose it is up to each one to find their own approach?

I finished all levels. I'm very happy with the end product, it was a lot of work to get it done. The only thing that feels a bit unfinished is the search button and input field. I didn't know how to make both button and enter key submit the value, nor how to style them properly with CSS.

For the project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, an open weather API, and the geolocation API.
