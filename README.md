# Weather App

The task was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API
The app should: 
a) fetch data from the API; 
b) the data should be presented in the specified format; 
c)the page should be responsive

The stretch goals included: 
a)change the colors of the page based on the weather; 
b)give the user the option to choose between a couple of cities; 
c)include visual indicators for the type of weather, cloudy/sunny/rainy/etc;

## The problem

We used the following tools to achieve the goals:
a) Method fetch() to get data from the API;
b) Method Array.from() to creat arrays of necessary data;
c) Methods forEach() and map() to iterate through arrays to modify the data and present it in the html file;
d) Media Queries to make the page responseive.
