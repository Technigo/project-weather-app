# Weather App
This weeks project was the create a weather app using fetch API from Open Weather Apps. Focus this week was to get familiar with how to fetch API and an understanding of information to use. 

## The problem
I started this week with the fetch functions, to see that all information needed was printed out in the console. 

After that I added a search field where I made it possible to search for any city in the world. The problem was how to get the local time depending on city searched. 
I solved the problem by help from a team mate. 

The site change color depending on temperature. I aimed for black level, but that was not possible with this timeframe. If I had more time I would try to use the geolocation to reach black level. I would also have tried to display the forcast date using grid instead of flexbox.
