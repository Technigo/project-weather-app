# Weather App

The aim of this project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature as well as a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

The challenge for this project was learning what an API is and how to use it. To build the app and understanding API's my main objective was getting the app to fetch the correct information from the weather API. To achieve this I practised using JSON and how to use 'fetch()', promises and the 'Date()' object ion JavaScript. After I managed to get all the information I wanted to be displayed in the app (today's weather and the 5-day forecast), I focused on styling the app depending on the weather by creating arrays with the different styling for each weather. I also decided to add animations for each weather type to practice using CSS. After I had gotten the app to look as desired, I focused on making it more responsive and interactive. I wanted a potential user to be able to choose which city they wanted to see the weather for, why I created a search function which gets the weather info of a chosen city from the API.
