# Weather App

This is an easy-looking web page that has pretty elaborated code behind the scenes. It fetches weather information from an open API that updates every 4 hours. 

## The problem

The main problem was to sort and show the forecast information from the API. The styling wasn't easy either; if I had more time, I would like to change the icons and improve the responsiveness for tablets and PC screens.
