# Weather App - Overview

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

Learning Objectives:
1. What an API is and how to use it
2. Basic JSON
3. How to use `fetch()` in JavaScript
4. How to use promises in JavaScript
5. How to work with the `Date()` object in JavaScript

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## Core Tech
- JavaScript
- API
- HTML5
- CSS



## Requirements Completed
**ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum)**
- You should fetch data from the API using `fetch()` in JavaScript
- All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API
<!-- - The presentation of the data should be in the specified format. -->
- The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)

**ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**
<!-- - Change the colors of the page based on the weather. If the weather is warm â€“ use warm colors. If the weather is colder, use cold colors. If you really want to push you CSS muscles you can even make a background gradient
- Add multiple cities
Give the user the option to choose between a couple of your favorite cities. -->
- Include visual indicators for the type of weather, cloudy/sunny/rainy/etc

<!-- **âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)**
- **Use your location*
Use the [Geolocation API](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp) that is built in to your browser to fetch the city that you are located in atm and show the weather for your location.
- Explore the API and use another endpoint of the Weather API to include supplementary information
- Add some CSS animations to your app, e.g. pulsating sun/rain drops -->
