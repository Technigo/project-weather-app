# Weather App

The project objective is to build a web app that fetches weather data from another website API and displays it in designed format.

## The problem

I have troubles dealing with timestamp, timezone, date, hours...It just took so many hours to understand how to read the data and convert it into a readable format.
Also, i learn new ways to apply object & array to organize data.
Functions, esp function arguments/parameters are still something I am not really sure yet. Just try them and have faith.
