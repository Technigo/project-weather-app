# Weather App

##Describe the project.
The assignment was to make a weather app and fetching the weather from an API.

## The problem
This was our first project as a pair, so we started with a videocall to form our ideas for the webpage.
We made a html document and built the structure.
There was some struggles with google meet who only let us create a video room for one hour at a time, and sometimes we got kicked out when we were in the middle of something. Fortunetely it's easy to make a new video chat room.
We divided the work between the three of us based on what part of the project we felt most eager to code.

We had some problems with understanding how to get the correct information from the API, but google, other students code and chatGPT helped us figure things out.

When we made the merging on GitHub we would have appreciated some more info on how to do and how it works. The "how to work in teams" video provided from Technigo didn't help as much as we had hoped, as a person sitting on all the branches i merging, while we had different versions on github we had to merge. This took too much time, and could easily be solved with better instructions, so please provide this for the next project as we still dont understand this. We managed to merge, but don't really know what happened.

It was easy to fetch, but hard to display the data for the 5-day forecast.
There was also hard to start styling the page before merging, since all the information wasn't available. There was not too much time for styling.

Another thing that was a little hard during this project was to find a time that fitted all three persons in the group.
We wanted to do a responsive design where the background would change according to weather/ temperature, however we did not have enough time this week. If we had more time it would also be cool to have a search feature to be able to search for the weather in another city. And also to be able to "search for sunny cities" and get a list of them to be able to plan a trip based on the weather.
