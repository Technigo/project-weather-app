# Weather App

The aim of this project was to build a weather app in order to practice fetching API data, and to follow a predefined design as closely as possible.

## The problem

The API used was openweathermap.org. Once we stumbled upon a problem, we used google, stack overflow and w3schools to find help.

If we had more time, we would make the app more accurate - have more weather options (and designs) in our if-else statements.
