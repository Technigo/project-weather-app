# Weather App

The project was to build a weather app, that fetch weather forcast from an API. The page is responsive and we have added an accordion to toggle a five days forcast.

## The problem

We started with the basic requerments. Used google and Stackoverflow alot. We didn't add much extra, except the accordion and diffrent Icons that changes depending on if it's misty, snowy etc. We are happy with our minimalistic design;)

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
