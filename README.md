# Weather App

The project was about creating a weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

Requirements

✓ You should fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript

✓ All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API

✓ The presentation of the data should be in the specified format.

✓ The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)

✓ Steps 1 & 2 should be done together and step 3 should be done in branches


## The problem

We worked to according to the instructions and used stack over flow and google to solve some of the problems we approached. 
If there was more time, we would have made the code more efficiant and tighter. And solve the timezone problem.
