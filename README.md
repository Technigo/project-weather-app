# Weather App

For the 3rd week project, we created a weather app in pairs. 

## The problem

One problem we haven't solve is that the sunset and sunrise time only works for cities with the same timezone as us. Hopefully in the future we can find a solution to that. 
We had some problems with making the search city to work. There are some confusion here and there, but we managed to solve it. We Google a lot and we also try to see how other people do it. For this project especially, we are very proud that we actually make something from scratch.
