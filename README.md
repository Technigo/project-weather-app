My sixth project at Technigo's frontend boot camp.
This week's project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.
In this project I learned how to fetch data from an API, basic JSON, how to use `fetch()` and promises and work with the `Date()` object in JavaScript. I also used CSS grid for this project.
