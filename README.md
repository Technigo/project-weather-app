# Weather App

Created a basic weather app which shows todays weather and the weather for the four upcoming days.

## The problem

I approach this task by type down what kind of data I needed to meet the requirements and how to get it. Breaked it down into smaller pieces and followed it step by step.
I search for different solutions on problems that occured and read material on different platforms that provides web development tutorials to understand different methods.

With more time I would add a search bar, more weather information overall like min/max temp, show the weather of more time periods during the days and weather icons in the forecast
