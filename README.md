# Weather App

This assignment is a vanilla JavaScript weather application project where weather data is fetched from an API using an API key, and then the application interface displays the weather information along with visual styles like different weather icons and color themes to represent the current conditions.

## The problem

To construct the app, I initially utilized the fetch() function to retrieve weather data for both daily forecasts and 5-day predictions. Subsequently, I parsed and displayed this data in accordance with the UI/UX design outlined in Figma.

A significant challenge arose when I had to convert Unix time strings into local time. Initially, I found this process confusing due to my lack of familiarity with this time format. However, after conducting thorough research, I successfully identified and implemented the correct solution.

Moreover, I endeavored to enhance the user experience by incorporating additional icons and adjusting the UI color theme to correspond with various weather conditions.

## A tryout
* I used Javascript modules to load iconArr.js and script.js separately. So the js files are cleaner.
