# Weather App

Mission was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.


## The problem

This has been a very fun project! 
I started by getting the raw API data to show in the right way. Used the videos, tried a lot of things and used Google even more. Also had great conversations with my team. Then I started some simple styling and responsive design, mobile priority. Also some stretch goals i think.
I coded in VS Code, used Live Server to update and the Inspector in Chrome to view code and errors. Also used some plug-ins for JSON to view the structure easier.

If I hade more time it would be put into more functions and design. Would love to have the background color and gradient to match the local time and weather description. So if it's a bright sunrise it would show and so on.
