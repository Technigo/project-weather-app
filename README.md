This is a project made during our sixth week at the Technigo bootcamp. The learning objective was to get familiar with APIs and how to use them by building a simple weather app.

# Weather App

This was a group assignment som we have built the weather app with API responses pair programming this week. We practiced basic JSON, using fetch method and promises to get the right information from the API. 

## The problem

We approached the problem with VS Code Live share and tried to advance together as much as possible. Occasionally we also worked on our own but always merged our individual progression into one common code. We used devtools for problemshooting. If we would have more time we would continue with a few more styling effects and try out the Geolocation API in the browser together with another endpoint of the API.
