## Project 5: Weather App
This project is a weather app fetching and displaying data from a weather api.For this project I used a ready design and tried to make the app look as close to is as possible. The screen design changes accordingly to the weather conditions. There is also an option to change the location using a dropdown menu. 

## The process

1. Fetch and display data from the api.
2. Set sunrise/sunset times
3. Add a dropdown menu with locations.
4. Style the app. 
5. Created a function allowing the design to change according to the weather conditions.

## Focus
