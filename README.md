# Weather App

The assignment was to build a weather app using a public API. 

## The problem


Once I felt that I somewhat understood the assignment after the second code along I built the app as I went along. I wish that I had asked my team members at the start in order to make a plan and then act it out. I wish that I first made the outline of all the elements that should be in the project and when they work and I understand how I got them to work I would start with the CSS. I knew before about my issues of asking for help but with this bootcamp I realize that it's even a bigger issue than I thought. I finally pushed myself to ask my team for help and it felt really good! 

If I had more time I would fix the issue with the forecast and I would style it even more and make the responsiveness look better.
