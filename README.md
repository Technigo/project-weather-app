# Weather App

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

This assignment made my go freaking nuts! :D We were suppose to do a weather app and it sounded pretty easy with the APIs but I was totally wrong! Thank god I'm finished now... 

## The problem

Omg where to start... I thought it was so hard to understand how to get all the different information into my website. Especially with the 5 days forcast. I looked at all kind of videos, firstly technigos a couple of times but still Couldnâ€™t get it. Than I looked up on youtube "How to to a simple weather app in javascript" and came a little bit forward thanks to that. But than I was stuck again. :D I think I have put down around 50 hours on this project... How I solved the problems? Actually thanks to google and my team! :D Ofc I understand more thanks to all the videos and materials I gone through but I could have never done this without google and my team ðŸ˜… This was the hardest project for me (and ofc the pizzabot) :D 

BTW: My "todays Weather Image" jumps around a little depending on the which size u have, didn't Figure out how to have it at the same spot at all time during the responsivness. But It looks kind of playful with the image jumping around. :)
