# Weather App

The project was to create a weather app using an api and to fetch it through JavaScript. It also included to display information such as weather today, a 5 day forecast and sunrise and sunset timings. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
As I found this as a very fun and challenging project, I decided to try to achieve black level. I used two different api's to fetch the weather for Lysekil, my home town. Additionally I used if/else functions to change both background and text depending on the weather and temperature. Instead of spending to much time on the design I choosed to instead spend time to expand to fetching weather forecast by geographic coordinates. I created similar values for the geographic coordinates as for Lysekils weather. Lastly I got inspirated by another page I saw, and I decided to create a nav bar (as an animation) and add multiple pages so that I could navigate through different site depending on what weather I'd like to display. I'd say that this was the most challenging part, and even though I spent more time on that part than on the weather api's I'd enjoyed it a lot and I think I learnt so much during this process. 

If I had more time I would defenetily spent it on the design, and use map to be able to manage the design of the 5 day forecast even more (as I thought I got limited in my design due to the usage of forEach instead of map.
