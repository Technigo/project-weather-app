# Weather App

This weeks project was to build a simple weather app that shows today's weather, temperature and a 5 day forecast using the Open Weather API.
The weather site had to be responsive and work on phone, tablet and desktop.

## The problem

To start with I created the backbone of my site using elements in HTML, and then in JavaScript I built a map and foreach method to populate those elements. I decided to use this route instead of buidling the HTML in JavaScript to make my site load faster. I then created variables for my API URL's and API key to help keep my fetch function clean.

I used JavaScript's fetch method to get the data I needed from the Open Weather API. This is my first time working with API's, so I learned a lot about understanding its documentation and enjoyed learning about promises and how to extract that data from JSON object.

Both sections are built using Flexbox, which change direction depending on the device it is being viewed from.
