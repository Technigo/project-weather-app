# Weather App

This project's goal is to build a weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using the Open Weather API.

## The problem

We have used fetch() method and promises to have all the data we need from the Open Weather API. So we learned about understanding its documentation and the different parameters in its URL. We were able to add more cities and give our own touch of style to the project.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
