# Weather App

Technigo bootcamp. The task was to build an weather page with a open API.

## The problem

Got the information from a API with fetch. 
I had problem with the stylig, couldn't get the background for the whole webpage. 
If I had more time I would definitely fix that. 

Also if I had more time I would add more styling and more information from the API. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
