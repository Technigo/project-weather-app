# Luna Weather ðŸŒ¦

This is a project I made when doing the Technigo bootcamp (autumn 2020). The project was to learn basic JSON and how to use an API and fetch in Javascript.

Luna Weather is a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem ðŸ’¡

- I used fetch in JavaScript (JS) to fetch all the data from the API.
- I generated HTML for the weekly forecast using...
- Depending on the temperature, the color of the page will change, which was implemented by a simple JS function.
- I also created JS functions to convert time to readble format, actual date to weekday name, temperature to 1 decimal and country code to country name.
- The weather icons are implemented by a conditional JS function, showing different icons depending on the weather.
- The web app is responsive and works on mobile, tablet and desktop, built with the mobile first approach. 
- I used flexbox to structure the layout of the page.
- After deploying the news site I tested it on several browsers, such as google chrome, safari and firefox. I also tested the newssite on different devices with different devtools in google chrome and safari.
