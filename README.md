# Weather App

I need to built here a basic weather app using javascript.

## The problem

Everything was a problem for the first, hard to understand a new language actually. I know the basics, how to practise in codesandbox, but using in the "real life" is much more difficult. So I started read a lot. Ask my team, what was their solutions, my friends who are developers at companies, tell me more about javascript. I asked my husband to watch my code, helped find the bugs, and now I understand.
