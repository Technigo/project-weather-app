# Weather App

This project was made during the Technigo Bootcamp.
We where supposed to create a dynamic weather app using API.


## The problem

This was my first time using fetch and API. 
I started mobile first approch and went from top to bottom adding fetching the right values from the API. 
After the fetch i went back and needed to make adjustment to the values so that they became more readable. 

If i had more time i would go over my JS code and change how i created my favourite cities. At the moment it 
is alot of repeating code and the project would be much better with another structure on that specific part.


## TECH USED
