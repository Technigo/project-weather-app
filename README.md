# Weather app
 This is a project from week 4 of the Technigo Bootcamp.

This weather app will provide 5 days weather forecast in a city of your search. It will save the search results so that they will not disappear when you reopen the page.

## The problem

I have encountered many problems. One of them has not been solved yet. That is, when you click on a delete city button, it works in an unexpected way. I will have to come back and fix this in the future.
The hardest thing was converting JS stored time to readable time, and I did a lot of experimenting with time to see what the difference was between the different build in methods.
I also find it very challenging to implement many functions and event handlers in one function, because it often behaves differently when you change an order. When to hide things and when to show them again was also something I had to learn a lot about. I also find it difficult to think about how to break down functions into smaller functions, as it gets pretty big. I should come back to fix and refactor this project and fix some bugs.
