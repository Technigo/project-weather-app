# Weather App

This week's project was to build a simple weather dashboard that uses a weather API to tell today's weather and temperature and a 4-day forecast.
Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

This assignment involved working in branches. I handled the HTML and JavaScript in the master branch, while the styling in CSS was done in a separate branch. The styling was derived from a separate design template, and the task required following the design as closely as possible. To assist with fetching the necessary data for creating features such as sunrise/sunset and weather forecast, I installed the JSON Viewer extension for Chrome, which proved to be very helpful. If I had more time I would have done weather for more cities.
