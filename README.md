# Weather App
Welcome to the weather forecast website. You can check here weather for two Scandinavian cities, Malmö and Stockholm. You may observe the weather at the moment and for the next five following days. Please, choose the city you are interested in by checking by opening so called ‘hamburger menu’.

## The problem
Writing the function for our forecast so the background image/colors on the website are changing based on the current weather.
Working as a team with different branches was a new challenge.
