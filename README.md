# Weather App

The weather app - Technig BootCamp
The assignment was to build a weather-app and fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript. The page should work on the mobile (mobile first!). 

I had a very tough week, which meant that I had to lower my ambitions of striving for red and black levels. I'm still happy that I succeeded with the APIs, but really want to catch up by developing design and downloading weather icons.
