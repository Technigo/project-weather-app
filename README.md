# Weather App

Creating a weather app using API's and JavaScript to show a 5 day forecast.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
This project had the rockiest start I've ever put myself through. Doubting that I ever could create an app neverless understand the concept of APIs. Proud that I pushed through every obstacle and became creative with my solutions.
