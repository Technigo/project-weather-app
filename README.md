# Weather Web App

https://weatherweatherweather.netlify.com/

Build and design a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature in Stockholm, and a 5 day forecast. Adding my own illustrations that changes with the weather and sunrise/sunset, to make it more personal.

Built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using a weather API
