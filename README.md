# Weather App [View Live!](https://weather-app-by-ylva.netlify.app/)

### This project was made as part of Technigoâ€™s front-end developer boot camp Fall 2020.
This week's project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using the weather API OpenWeather.

During the project I have learnt

* What an API is and how to use it
* Basic JSON
* How to use `fetch()` in JavaScript
* How to use promises in JavaScript
* How to work with the `Date()` object in JavaScript

## The process and structure
During this project, some of us in Team Zebra's have worked together. On Monday and Tuesday, we helped to get the fetch functions in place and retrieve from the API the data we want to work with.

We made sure to create small functions for the different parts that would later be presented on the page.

Needed two fetch functions, one for today's weather and one for 5 days forcast. Decided to create main functions to be used to build up our HTML tree on our website.

It feels like we got a good start and structure.
 
After Tuesday we had all need functions in place and a basic design which I later on in the week worked with to make it responsive.

If I have had more time I would have

* Made sure to have the correct timezone for searched city, so the time for the city and sunrise and sunset get's correct.
