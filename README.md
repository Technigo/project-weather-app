# Weather App

A Weather Web App built with "Vanilla" JavaScript using OpenWeather API.

## Geolocation and conditional rendering

Shows today's weather and temperature. A five-day forecast and time of sunsets and sunrise. It uses the browsers Geolocation to detect what city to check and the colours conditionally renders based on the weather.

## Date object and time conversion

Sunrise and sunset are converted from unix timestamp and then offset with the time difference to show the local time for each location.
