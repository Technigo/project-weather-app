This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp. It looks best in a mobile-format. 

# Weather App
The assignment was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. The aim was to practise using API:s, json, fetch, promises and the Date-object in Javascript. 

In the app there's three different designs with different background- and font-colors, images and heading depending of what type of weather it is. We solved that by using a switch statement and fetched the current weather from the API, changing the appearance of the design from within the switch. 

If we had had more time maybe we would have made a design of our own, with icons and more cities to chose from.
