# Weather App

This assignment is a vanilla JavaScript weather application project where weather data is fetched from an API using an API key, and then the application interface displays the weather information along with visual styles like different weather icons and color themes to represent the current conditions.

## The problem

For building the app, I started with using fetch() function to fetch the weather data from daily weather and 5-day forecast accordingly, and then deconstruct the data and display them along the UI/UX design provided in Figma.

The main problem i encountered in the process was converting Unix time string into the local time. It was consuding in the beginnign since I wasn't familiar with this kind of time formate. In the end, after researching, I found the correct solution. 

Additionaly, I tried to add in more icons and UI color theme to fit different weather conditions.
