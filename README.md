# Weather App

The assignment of week 7 was to create a weather app using an open API source. The challenge was to fetch() data from given API, calculate or/and find use the right formatting to make the data readible for the user.

The assignment also included following a design as closely as possible.

## The problem

I have mainly worked with JavaScript. To be able to use data for my weather app I have been fetching the data from the API and worked wwith different methods to extract the format of the data i wished to use - which was the most time consuming part, trying to find and understand how the code works, and what it actually does. This has been a challenging project for me, mostly due to time restrictions. But if I were to be given more time my code would be cleaner, and the design would resemble the given design to follow. I would also spend more time on understanding how everything is build and do more innerHTML rather than having so much code in the index file.

Chat GPT was once again a great companion.
