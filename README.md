# Weather App
Viktor and Marias Weather APP :)

A pair project with the goal to develop a weather app. Primary focus to practice JavaScript, learn how to use API and work in branches.

## The problem

Firstly, we concentrated on deciding on the design and creating the HTML, CSS and JS files and fetching our API. Secondly, we created a styling branch and then an API branch to work on the CSS and JS. Finally, we merged the branches and made the final touch using mob programming.
If we had more time, we would love to add a geolocation feature, to change weather depending on the user's geolocation. We would also love to style the app with adding gradients.
