# Weather App

We made a weather app which fetches live data from an API to display the current temperature, five-day forecast, sunrise and sunset times in Stockholm. As part of the task we also had to style the app to match one of the given designs. This included a specific font, colour and image. As part of our stretch goals we pushed the styling further by making the colours, image and text change according to if the weather featured clouds, rain or something else. We also stretched ourselves further by adding an additional feature which shows the temperature in two other cities.

## The problem

In our group of three we tried to be as communicative and methodical as possible when approaching the project. We started by agreeing to all review the resources for the week so that we were up-to-date with the learning materials. We also set out some agreed deadlines for the week in-line with all our schedules. We set agendas for every meeting to make sure we were clear on our goals for the session and for our individual work.
After Fanny forked the repo, we started with a mob programming approach, and set up the HTML, CSS and Javascript files and class names needed for the app to work. We fetched data from the API together and presented some basic data on the app. After this, we each created our own branch so we could add a sunrise/sunset feature, a forecast feature and some styling in another branch. Some feature work was completed together and some individually. One of our biggest hurdles was realising that the API key might have to be edited for some of the data to be presented accurately. We managed to fix our problems and then merged the branches together successfully. If we had more time, we would add even more features, like the ability to find the weather by location, for example.
