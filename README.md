# Weather App
Developers of Weather App: Lars Söderman, Sofia Arzt Wallén, and Elaine Bergström. 

This was the project #7 at Technigo frontend boot camp. The project itself consisted in building a simple weather web app that shows todays weather and temperature and a 5day forecast using a weather API. It was also an exercise in pair-programming. 

## The problem

While we didn't have a specific technical problem we found ourselves struggling with pair programming in the beginning. We all had different ways of approaching the project but needed to step back from it to make sure we were all on the same page of understanding. We decided to approach this project from a simpler design so that we could better understand how to work with each other.

If we had more time we would add more complicated features like other cities, showing more data like humidity. We would also love to have the style change according to the time of day (night/day), or fetch different icons or images of the city it's currently showing.
