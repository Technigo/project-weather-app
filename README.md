# Weather App

This week's assignment was to create a Weather App based on the OpenWeathermap-APIs, designed and coded mobile-first.   

## The problem

This week I started working without any form of structure or planning, probably due to my eagerness to start testing the API and fetch-syntax. As a result I got a bit stressed and ended up spending a couple of evenings just trying to set the final design and figuring out how to organize my code. At one point I added several functions, of which I got none to work that day. 

Due to the format of the API I also ran into problems regarding the forecast and filtering the data. This part took me quite some time to sort out, partly with help from Maks. However, in the end all this troubleshooting and bug-fixing made me feel much more comfortable adding/removing and modifying my code, and in other words I really understood what I was writing. When I added the Geolocation-functionality I also got to organize my code in a way that I think would be a good approach for API's in the long run. The fetch is a separate function, and the api-variables are simply added to it. That way you can use the same function for multiple API's.

If I had more time I'd definitely fix the not-a-form approach I used for the search-function (sorry you had to see that). I would also love to explore using the JS-classes and it's uses, to avoid calling about 20+ html-queries.

As a tribute to the feeling of working with somewhat constant bug-fixing I named the project Weatherbug. Note that the bug actually could pass for a sun, even more so when you hover over the logo (lol!).
