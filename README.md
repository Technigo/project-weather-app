# The Weather Web App :sunny:

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

## What I have learned ðŸ§ 

- What an API is and how to use it
- Basic JSON
- How to use fetch() in Javascript
- How to use promises in JavaScript
- How to work with the Date() object in JavaScript

## the weather API

### Present some data on your web app

Your task is to present the data: the city name, the temperature (rounded to 1 decimal place), and what type of weather it is (the "description" in the JSON)

### Sunrise and sunset ðŸŒ‡

Show the time for sunrise and sunset in a readable time format (Example: 13:00 or 1 PM). 
The format the date is coded from milliseconds to a readble format.

### Weather forecast

A forecast for the next 5 days. With days min and max temperature.

## Requirements ðŸ§ª

- You should fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript 
- All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API
- The presentation of the data should be in the specified format. 
- The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)- 
- Code follows Technigoâ€™s code guidelines.
- Contribute by helping others with this project on Stack Overflow.
- If selected; demo your solution for your team.

**_Design_**

I used design 2 as inspiration in layout, colors and fonts.

I changed the colors of a section based on the weather and added a message about what you can do. [background gradient.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)
