# Weather App

The task was to build a weather app fetching data from an API to show today's weather and temperature. I has a 5-day forecast, following specific design guidelines and ensuring responsiveness.

## The problem

Fetching weather data from an API was a bit challenging, and I struggled with displaying only one decimal point and working with SVG images. Additionally, I faced difficulty in making my design work without using two separate links for weather and forecast data. If I had more time, I'd add more cities and enhancing the overall user experience.
