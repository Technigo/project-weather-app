# Weather App

This project involves creating a responsive web application that displays weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app should feature the current weather conditions, a 4-day forecast, sunrise and sunset times, and adhere closely to a chosen design from provided assets.

## The problem

The development process includes setting up the project foundation in the main/master branch and adding features through branching and merging as detailed in the instructions. It was first time so difficult to get the concept.
