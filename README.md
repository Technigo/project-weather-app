# Weather App - Bridget & Emilia

For this project, Bridget and Emilia worked together to develop a weather forecast website using two APIs to gather the weather information for today and for the next five days.  We learned how to fetch and utilize APIs, how to create and merge branches in git, and how to create dynamic styling controlled by conditionals.

## The problem

One part of the problem was learning how to use APIs and correctly extract data from different objects and arrays.  For this, we referred to course material to learn and replicate.  The other part of the problem was learning how to work in a small team and navigate the tools as a team.  We had to learn how to branch a fork and merge branches - which, honestly, went a lot smoother than either of us were anticipating.  We also had to coordinate our time and work together.  We used a FigJam to plan. We met online and in person to establish our repo as well as work on our branches and merge our work together. 

If we had more time, we would condense our code quite significantly.  Right now, we have four API fetch requests, and it seems like we could do it with two fetch requests in one function.  We have begun to get the information for how to accomplish this, but have not had time to implement.
