# Weather App
I have fetched all the required API data but I haven't had time to finish my site yet. I have the CSS styling left to fix! 

## The problem
I had to try many things out and research my way to get the required data out. Super fun and super tricky! I try to keep the code as minimalistic as I can, both for me to understand and for future purposes. I've been reading others' code a lot to figure out how to solve my problems. I am very grateful for having a lot of smart classmates around to get inspiration from.
