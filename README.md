# Weather App

This weeks project was to build a weather site fetching data from Open Weather Maps.
The focus was to get familiar with using APIs. 
## The problem
I started with the fetch functions, making sure all the data was retrieved and printed it in the console. When I had my data in place i put it to display in the html.

When I had everything in place for a specified city, I changed the code into using geo-location.
