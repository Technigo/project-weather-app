# Weather App

This week's project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using weather API's.

## The problem

This week has been to dive more into javascript and use data fetched from API calls. The hardest part has been to understand and know how to filter the data in the API.
