# Weather App

Made a minimalistic weather app showing the weather for Oslo, Norway

## The problem

Solved the task according to the brief.
Would have added search, dynamic night/day styles and geolocation of user if i had more time.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
