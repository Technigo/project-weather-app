# Weather App
This weeks assignment was to create a weather app using external data from an API. We could chose between two different designs and I chose the second design option. I based my weather app on data of the current weather in Stockholm and a 4-day forecast. During this project we used the fetch functions to implement the data from the API.

## The problem
This week was better than the two previous ones for me. I tried to be extra attentive during the live sessions this week and took notes. I used different helpful tools such as google, chatgbt and the inspector. If I had more time I would look into how I could show the 4-day forecast data with the degrees on the right side and the days on the left. I tried this out but I didn't manage to make it work. When I tried it out something else in the code changed and I ended up having the days and the degrees next to each other instead.
