# Weather App

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
