# Weather App

This week we are diving into the world of APIs and Promoises. We got assigned to create a weather app using functions like fetch and others?

Isaac and Andrej got assigned in the same group and here is our project (nearly perfect).

## The problem

Javascript
The main problem or more like obsticale was to fetch and convert the data so it looks more readable from the API.
To manipulate the

CSS
What we needed is more knowledge in the world of CSS and how it works with javascript.

We solved most of our problems by searching through the internet, forums like Stackoverflow and such. Our experience from this project was to identify the problem and find more than 1 solution.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
