Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

Building a weather app by using fetch requests and external APIs. We decided to go for Design 2 of the two ones that was provided. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
