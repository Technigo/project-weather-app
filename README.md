# Weather App

This week's project is to build a simple weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

At first we worked together with mob programming getting the API to work. Then we pair programmed in branches for different features.

If we had more time we would have had more cities.
