# Weather App
Fetch data with APIs to do an weather app.

## The problem

Using the fetch method to get data from API´s. I understood the basics but where never able to go progress but i´m proud over myself that i got a project to send in this week, with a lot of support from teachers and classmates I held my nose about surface. I struggled with the logic over the connections from on place to another and have to use last weeks knowledge, that was not super clear to my, and apply that with so much more info was hard. But the outcome is a weather app.
