# Week 6: weather app

This week's (week 6) assignment was to create a weather app in a group. The objectives we had was to fetch APIs and inject them into the HTML in order to display the correct weather data.

## The problem

We started by structuring the HTML and fetching the first API (weather), as a group. We learned really soon that most of the structure we had previously built could be written directly into the JavaScript. We then splited into three branches (styling, sun data and forecast) and worked in a parallel way. We finally merged our work together and finished the styling all together.
