# Weather App

Our assignment was to build a weather app that showed today's weather in local time (temperature, description and time for sunset/sunrise) and a forecast of five days. We could choose from two designs and were supposed to follow the chosen design and make it change depending on time, i.e on design for the night and one for the day.


## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
