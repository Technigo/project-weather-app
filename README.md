The project was about creating a weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## Requirements

✓ All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API

✓ The presentation of the data should be in the specified format.

✓ The page should be responsive, mobile first.

✓ You should work in pair using branches.


## The problem

We worked according to the instructions and used stack over flow and google to solve some of the problems we approached. 
If there was more time, we would have made landing page prettier.
