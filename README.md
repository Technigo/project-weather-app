# Weather App
This is a weather App project for Technigo Bootcamp.

It has a multiple city selection and displays time, temperature, which temperature it feels like, sunset/sunrise and a five day forecast.

## The problem

The assignment was to creat a mobile.first weather app that uses an API.
The blue level required fetching data from an API in JS, presenting a cityname, temperature, weather description, sunset and sunrise and a five day forecast.

To push my knowledge a bit further I chose to change the background a bit. It changes depending on what city you've chosen in a menu and alse adds a transparent layer which changes the background to a darker/lighter version depending on time in the specified city.

I also added an icon which changes depending on weather.

I chose to go with the grid-layout this project, since I find it interesting to work with. I find that the grid-layout is a bit easier to make responsive rather than just using flex-boxes.
