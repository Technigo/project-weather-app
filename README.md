# Weather App

This task involves building a weather app that fetches data from an API and presents it in a user-friendly format. The app should display the city name, current temperature (rounded to one decimal place), and a weather description. Additional features include showing the sunrise and sunset times in a readable format, and a four-day weather forecast, using data from the API filtered to display the same time each day (e.g., 12:00). The app must be styled to match a provided design and be responsive for different screen sizes

## The problem

Initially, I found it quite challenging to understand how to properly code for retrieving data from the API. Eventually, things started to click, especially when it came to fetching specific data, such as the current temperature. However, when the data was displayed in formats like milliseconds, I encountered a new issue. I had to solve that by writing additional code to convert the milliseconds into the correct time, date, temperature, etc. It was tricky, but after a lot of Googling, I managed to format the data correctly.

Another challenge was styling the app, as it had been a while since I last worked on CSS. It took some time to get back into it. Getting the forecast for the next four days was also difficult, but I managed to resolve that issue as well, thanks to Google and ChatGPT.
