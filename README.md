# Weather App

This week's project was to build a weather dashboard that uses a API to tell today's weather and a 5-day forecast.

## The problem

I started with fetching the weather for today. It went pretty quick and the biggest challenge in this step was following the proposed design.
The biggest challenge and what I spent the most time on was iterating through the five day weather report and getting the min and max temperature values for each day.

I implemented some extra features such as different background colors depending on whether the sun has risen or set and a search function so the user can change location.

If I had more time, I would have made a page that appears when the user searches in a location that does not exist. Currently, the app keeps the last correct search and no update takes place.
