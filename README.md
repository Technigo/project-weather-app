# Weather App

This is the weather app will show 5 days weather. 

## The problem

Fetch API itself seems not hard. Maybe because now we only work with "get". Overall, the time zone was the hardest part. It was a good practice when filtered the data. I guess in real life project we will work with more and more complicated arrays. I've played around as much as I can. Unfortunately I am not able to work on the stretch goals. But the background color and text will be changed by the weather and temperature which is my favorate part. If I have enough time, I would like to make the 'next a few days' weather more details. I wanted to make a dropdown information and hover, but I couldn't make it in a nice way so I deleted. Furthermore, I don't know why. Seems responsive design was the most difficult part to me. I've tried differen ways but didn't work. I have asked on stack over, hopefully I will get an answer next week then I will make a change.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
