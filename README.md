# Weather App

This week we had to create a weather app using an API. This was done with implementing an API. For this assignment we worked in groups to practice to work in branches and how to merge them togheter. The app presents the current weather on top and a 7-day forecast at the bottom.

## The problem

We planned at least one session every weekday so everyone in the group had a chance to particpate. We tried to implement mob programming which we did to some extent but it was adapted more loosley than followed strictly. All in all the teamwork parts worked out great and everyone came with different inputs helping us as a group to develop an easy and hands on weather app as our first group project!

If we would have more time we would implement more features and more weather card stylings.
