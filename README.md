# Weather App

The project was to build a weather app from scratch, using APIs to show today's weather and a 5 day forecast.

## The problem

This project was done two-and-two so we did pair programming in VS Code.

We started by fetching the APIs to the js document to make sure that we had the different data that we needed for the app.
We then looked at the two designs provided in the repository file as well as some different weather sites to decide how we wanted to do the layout and design for our project.
Since the functions and the information we fetched work/look differrently on iOS vs Android we needed to put some extra time into finding fixes and implementing them in our code.

If we had more time we probably would have chosen other weather icons, but now we learned how to fetch it from APIs, which is the reason we decided to go with these.
We would also have looked into how to build a site where you can search any city for weather.
