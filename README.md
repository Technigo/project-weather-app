# Weather Compass

The assignment was to build a webpage that uses a weather API to display tody's weather, temperature, time of sunrise and sunset, as well as a four-day forecast.
I decided to base my project on the second of the two design options provided, and added a dropdown menu where the user can choose between four different cities.

## The problem

I started out by building a basic skeleton in html and by making sure that I could fetch the data from the API. Then I started building functions to fetch the data I needed. Once I had city name, daily temperature, and type of weather in place, I created new branches to work on sunrise + sunset time, styling, and the forecast. After merging the branches, I also added a dropdown menu with different cities.

I used a lot of console.logging in order to check that the functions fetched the data I needed. When running into problems, Stack Overflow proved a particularly useful recource, and ChatGPT was good at explaining solutions that I found online that at first appeared very confusing. Overall, a lot of trial and error.

If I had more time, I would have liked to try out creating a search bar, as well as CSS animations.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
