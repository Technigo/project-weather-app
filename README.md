# Weather App

This week's project wass to build a weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. We worked in a dev team to create the app.

## The problem

This was our first mob-programming github-project and we learnt a lot about working in a team, creating branches, fixing conflicts and mergin branches. We had some difficulties with everyone having different schedules but it was important for us that everyone was present during the first 2 steps, when we fetched the data. After that we worked in branches.

In the project, the icons and background color changes depending on the weather or temperature.

In the project we used switch conditionals, foreach statements and filtering functions.

We used the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) to get weather data for our project.
We got our icons from [Streamline HQ](https://streamlinehq.com/).

If we had more time we would use the [Geolocation](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp) API to fetch weather data for different countries or cities. We would also do some animations.
