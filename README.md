# Weather App

This weeks project was to create a weather app with data fetched from an API. 

## The problem

This week I mainly struggled with my own expectations rather than anything code related. I had a busier week than usual, which meant I had less time to focus on this week's project, so instead of aiming for reaching all the stretch goals and advanced stretch goals, I decided to do the requirements really well instead, and then only do one stretch goal when I felt like I had the basics down. I am usually someone who always aims or perfection, so this week I had to dial back a bit and "only" do what was necessary. Which was harder than I initially thought, but definitely necessary.
