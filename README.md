# Weather App

In this project I was supposed to create a weather app. The app should have the name of the city, current temperature, weather description, sunrise/sunset time and a 4-day forecast. The app should follow one of the designs as closely as possible.
It should also be responsive and look good on devices from 320px width up to 1600px.

## The problem

I started out looking at the designs and chose one. Then I tried to set up some basic HTML that I thought could match the design. After that I set up the API-URL and fetched the first data with the city name, temperature and the weather-description. I also found the local time, so that I could change the background & the sun/moon if the local time was during the day or after sunset.

Then I worked in branches, first the sunrise & sunset and after that the weather forecast, which was the most challenging one. I asked for help from buddies, google and chatGPT. The last branch had to do with styling, so I tried to make the app look like the design. If I had more time, I would like to try out getting the button functioning as well as having a search-field that works.
