# Weather App

Created a basic weather app which shows todays weather and the weather for the four upcoming days.

## The problem

I approach this task by type down what kind of data I needed to meet the requirements and how to get it. Breaked it down into smaller pieces and followed it step by step.
I search for different solutions on problems that occured and read material on different platforms that provides web development tutorials to understand different methods.

With more time I would add a search bar, more weather information overall like min/max temp, show the weather of more time periods during the days and weather icons in the forecast

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
