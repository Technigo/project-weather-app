# Weather App

This project is a weather web app that shows Stockholm's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.


## The problem

I used a fetch to fetch the weather data from the open API. I also customized the weather icons that change when the API is updated every 3 hours. The site is responsive with mobile first in mind. The desktop view has a hero-video. 

I started the project trying to get an overwiew of the goal and to visualize the end result. Then I went through some background material and eventually began to code. Initially, I basically just had lines of code and the next step - creating functions - were a bit more challenging. I got stuck and then un-stuck by looking at how others had solved stuff. I did not copy-paste but tried really hard to understand what was happening in their code. 

The styling was tricky this time since some elements were created in js. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to access various elements without affecting other elements.
