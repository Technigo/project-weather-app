# Weather App

This assignment was about making a weather-forecast-app, using APIs for the first time.

## The problem

I divided the layout in two sections, the weather today and the weather for the coming five days. I made it responsive to show less information on mobile and a little more on tablet and desktop. I used the icons that I got through json to illustrate the weather and also made the colors change with current temperatures. I used help through Stack Overflow.
