# Weather App

This was project was made by me at week 5 in the Technigo bootcamp. The project was to do a weather app by fetching two different API's, for todays weather and a five day forecast. 

## The problem

I had many difficulties during this project, I wanted to use icons connected to the current weather in Marbella. 
I didn't manage to make it work with the clouds descriptions in the API's objects so instead I used "if-statements" on todays degrees. 
If I knew how I would make my icons work on the forecast but I didn't fully unsterstood how to make it work with my "if-statement" in my forEach.
