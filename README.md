# Weather App
This project was made on week 3 for Technigo bootcamp as a mobprogramming project. 
(Cecilia Avila and Nina Str√∂yer)
This weeks project was to build a weather app that shows todays weather, temperature and a five day forecast using an weather API. The styling was from a set design.

## The problem

First time working in branches and spent a lot of time to figure it out. We also mobprogrammed in VSCode via LiveShare. If we had more time we would add more cities and geotagning.
