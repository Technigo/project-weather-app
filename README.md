# Weather App

The project for this week was to work in pairs and create a weather app where the weather information was fetched from Open Weather Map API. We were supposed to display the current weather with temperature as well as sunrise and sunset. The other part to display was the forecast for the upcoming five days.

## The problem

At the beginning of this week, we had a pair programming session where we decided on what approach to use and how we would work. We checked the brief and the requirements and started step by step in order to first reach the blue level, and then also the red. We started with the fetch to display the current weather and then made another fetch for the forecast, where we filtered in order to get the relevant details, and made a loop for the five days. We also decided to fetch the weather icons directly from the API instead of using icons locally saved. After completing the basic requirements we started working on the red level, where we started with changing the color based on weather. We inserted the parts through JS but made the styling in CSS. We also added a fetch for other cities. In order to achieve this we used HTML, CSS and Javascript. We also worked with API and used json files in order to find the correct data to use. We also used media queries in order to make it responsive, and added a footer which is only visible on desktop.
