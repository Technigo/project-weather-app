# Weather App

I've created a meteo app which display actual weather conditions and forecast for the following 4 days. My app use geolocation and different styling/audio effects based on weather.

## The problem

Was hard to filter all the arrays and loop over them, I've mostly found solution on the web. If I had more time I would add more weather informations and handle errors in different way.
