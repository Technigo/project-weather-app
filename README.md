# Weather App

This project helped me learn how to fetch data from API and display it in
a weather app.

## The problem

For this project I chose one of the giving designs and tried to make the app look as close to is as possible. I am proud of creating the structure of the page and Javascript logic from scratch.
I managed to resolve several issues:
-Displaying sunset/sunrise times in a readable way
-Making the design change according to the weather conditions
-Adding an option to choose a city

Technologies used:
-Javascript
-CSS
-HTMLS
