# Weather App
Weekly project in pairs, cooperative coding done by Leo Thunell and Yu Miao.
The assignment was to follow a specific design and contruct a weather forecast app with the use of API's-

## The problem
We had problems trying to fetch more than a 5 days forecast so we settled with 5.
Another hinderance was trying to get the geolocation function to work so that the site could track the users location to bring the forecast for that current location, which we never managed.
