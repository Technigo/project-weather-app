# Weather App

fetch todays weather via api
fetch forecast via api
create functions
work with DOM
work with foreach and filter
convert times and temperatures
style responsive page

## The problem

It was fun to work with APIs
I got to to use some parts of another weather project that I have done in the past, specifically where user can put in their city and then use API to fetch
I got to use previous knowledge on how to style a page and make it responsive
I got to work with innerHTML and how to manipulate DOM which is fun!
