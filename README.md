# Weather App

A responsive weather application fetching data from Open Weather.

## The problem

Started with the HTML structure, moved on to fetch and visualize current day and forecast weather data. For each and every step I used console.log to check whether I got the data I wanted, and if it was in a format ready to be visualized. Along the way I think of how to optimize the code and what I want to practise. There are only so many new things one can handle, next time I want to create an object only containing the data I use instead of passing the full weather and forecast object around. Styling happened along the way, when I needed a javascript-break.
