# Weather App

This project is a weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for the current weather in a specific city or allow the app to use their location via the Geolocation API. The app shows key information such as temperature, weather description, sunrise and sunset times, and a 5-day weather forecast.

## The problem

The task was to create a responsive weather app that retrieves data from an external API and presents it in a user-friendly format. The goal was also to implement a feature that fetches the user's current location and displays the weather based on that.

- Technologies: I used the following tools and technologies to build the app:

HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the interface.
JavaScript for fetching data using the fetch() API and manipulating the DOM to display the weather information.
OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data for the specified city or current location.
Responsive Design techniques to ensure the app works across various screen sizes.

- Challenges: The main challenge was ensuring the weather data (including background images) loaded efficiently, and formatting the dates (e.g., sunrise and sunset) into a user-friendly format.
