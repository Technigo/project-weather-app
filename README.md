# Weather App

This project was made during the Technigo Bootcamp.
We where supposed to create a dynamic weather app using API.


## The problem

This was my first time using fetch and API. 
I started mobile first approch and went from top to bottom and fetched the requested values from the API. 
When i had all the data i needed i went back and made adjustment to the values so that they became more readable. 
Then i choose to do a simple design and by using media queries i also made it responsive.

If i had more time i would go over my JS code and change how i created my favourite cities. At the moment it 
is alot of repeating code and the project would be much better with another structure on that specific part.
