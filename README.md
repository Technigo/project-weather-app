# Weather App

This was one of the projects at Technigo Bootcamp with focus on javascript and API's.

# Tech used ðŸ§ 

- API Fetch(), Date() & Promises
- JSON
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

# Requirements ðŸ§ª

- You should fetch data from the API using `fetch()` in JavaScript
- All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API
- The presentation of the data should be in the specified format.
- The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)

# The problem

If I would have more time on this project I would definitely try to clean up the code and make it shorter and smarter. I would also add different backgrounds depending on the weather and time of the day.
