# Weather App :sunny: ðŸŽ¨

I build an app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API from Open Weather Map.  

The background is changing based on weather, same as the picture and the greeting. I'm still working on making it more user friendly, and show the names of days, not the dates. 

The app is dedicated for phones, and tablets, but still looks good and simple on laptops.
