# Weather App

Assignment was to create a responsive weather app (webpage) that uses the Openweather API to fetch data from.

Site is responsive for phone/tablet/desktop. Difference between phone/tablet is that tablet version shows wind data.

## The problem

Decided to use the Onecall API from Open Weather rather than the one that was provided since I found it had more useful data and also simplified generating max/min temp. Lots of flexbox/CSS tuning in order to get the styling right. Probably could have simplified/made reuse in the CSS more if I had time.

Towards the end simplified my JS by using foreach with HTML selectors.
