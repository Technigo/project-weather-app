# Weather App

This project retrieves real-time weather data from a weather API, showcasing the current temperature and a 5-day forecast for a default city. Additional features allow users to cycle through various cities with a button click and use a search bar to find weather information for any specified city.


## The problem

I began by following the instructions step by step, finding it helpful to break tasks into small and manageable parts. Unexpected challenges came up along the way. For instance, displaying the high and low temperatures in a 5-day forecast required multiple steps. Initially, the high and low temperatures I displayed were identical because I was only retrieving data from a 3-hour span, which didn't show much variation. To address this, I made sure to collect data over a 24-hour period and then identify the highest highs and lowest lows during that time. Throughout the process, I took notes with pen and paper, adding smaller tasks under larger goals as they emerged.

I used ChatGPT for help with syntax questions and design challenges, such as creating the bottom curve for the main weather info.

Given more time, I would refine my code to eliminate any unnecessary elements left over from my problem-solving experiments. Additionally, I would explore CSS animations to create more engaging visuals. I would also incorporate more weather data and integrate a geolocation API for enhanced functionality.
