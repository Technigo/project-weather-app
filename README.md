# Weather App

This project is a weather dashboard that provides current weather and temperature information, as well as a five-day forecast, using weather API.

## The problem


Oscar- If/else if statements will be the death of me. I spent a lot of time searching a lot of sites for info but in the end, chatting with the animal team was the best way to solve the issue. I couldn't get the weather icons to show up for all of the days, but maybe in the future!

Malvina- The project involves working with branches on GitHub and practicing git commands. It also involves using fetch() and promises in JavaScript, along with Date() objects. The goal of this project is to provide a practical example of using these concepts to build a useful web application.
