# Weather App

THe assignment this week was to build a weather app using an API. The aim was to display the current weather, a weather forecast and the sunrise and sunset time. 

## The problem

It was quite difficult in the beginning as we had to start from scratch this week, so the first couple of days went to testing things out and asking peers. Then it finally started to make sense and I was able to do all the required steps. I then tried to tidy up the code as much as possible, as I had written many lines of code that was unessecary and confusing. Lastly I was inspired in my design by my peers and their demos! If I would have had more time I would have wanted to be able to add more cities.
