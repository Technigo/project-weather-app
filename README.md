# Weather App

This is a pair-programming application for week 3 in the Technigo Web Dev Boot Camp - this project is made by Ylva Karlsson and Emilia Granström Anundi.

## The problem

We started with the basic structure of the HTML, CSS and the JS-file for the Weather App.
Then we added the basic API fetch and got the city to work (we choosed Piteå for the task).
Then we fixed the format and aimed for the blue level requirements for this week since there were some issues with merging.

The biggest issue this week were how to work on branches and merge - which seemed to be hard for many people in our class to understand (so we were not alone but this ended up eating up much time).
