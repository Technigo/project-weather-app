# Weather App

Assignment from Technigo bootcamp. Create an weather app and practice fetching data from a public API.

## The problem

The difficult part was to make sense of all the data and the arrays and to filter out the objects I didn't need. Also to manage converting milliseconds to seconds and then to convert that data into a date to be able to use it on my site.
