# Weather App

To extract information from API to create your own weather app. The app should be responsive and show the currents days information as well as a forecast.

## The problem

Using the fetch() method we could get the information from the API. We has separare fetches for the current information and the forecast. Within these two fetches we populated the HTML with the APIs data. After we did some styling to create the app.
If we had more time we might have tried creating a function for the forecast rather than replicating the same forEach for two arrays of different lengths, but we are satisfied now to turn in as is.
