# Weather App

A responsive weather web app with a today's weather section, a five day forecast section and a hamburger menu that gives the user the option to choose between different cities. The goal of the week was to practise using APIS and learn Javascript methods related to that.

## The problem

We laid out the foundation of the project together and then we worked on the different features in smaller branches, both in smaller groups and individually. We chose to implement the first design in the folder. In the beginning we had some problems with Github and it took us some time to lern how to work in branches and merge them properly. We also experienced some challenges with Javascript, for example how make the background and the navbar change color depending on day/night and temperature and write that code in a non-repetitive way.
