# Weather App

Completed my first project, which involved integrating data from an open-source API into a weather application. This project provides a simple yet functional weather forecast for Dubai, for the upcoming five days. The forecast updates dynamically as new information is fetched from the API. In addition to the basic weather data, the app includes precise details about sunrise and sunset times for each day. From a design perspective, I incorporated an intuitive feature that allows users to toggle between a day and night mode, altering the visual theme to reflect different times of the day.

## The Problem
I began the project by focusing on the design, utilising HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing layout. Once the core design was in place, I worked on making it responsive, ensuring it would display well across various devices. The most challenging part came when I transitioned into adding dynamic elements using JavaScript. Since I was new to working with APIs, fetching data from the open-source API was a learning curve. The biggest hurdle I encountered was correctly positioning and displaying the fetched data within the HTML structure. Replacing static elements with live API data proved to be quite tricky, as I had to ensure the content was dynamically updated while maintaining the integrity of the design.
