# Weather App

This week's project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.


## The problem

I aimed for blue level using fetch to fetch the weather data from the open API. I customized the weather icons that change when the API is updated every 3 hours. The site is responsive with mobile first in mind. The desktop view has a hero-video. 

As I have done with the other projects, I started with trying to get an overwiew of the project and try to visualize the end result. Then I went through the material and eventually began to code. This time I managed to get all code down that was needed for the blue level requirements but it was just line after line with code. The next step - creating variables and functions - were a bit more challenging. I got stuck and then un-stuck by looking at how some fellow students had solved stuff. I did not copy-paste but tried really hard to understand what was happening in their code. 

The styling was tricky this time since some elements were created in js. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to access various elements without affecting other elements.
