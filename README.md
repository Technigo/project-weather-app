# Project 6 - Build a weather web application (Week 6)

### Summary

This weekÂ´s project (@ Technigo Boot Camp 2019) was to create a simple weather web application that shows today's weather and temperature and a weekly forecast, using a weather API.

My version of the application includes the following additional features:
