# Weather App

This weather app is a little tribute to my granpa who lives in little Gamleby and he, as a pension√§r is very busy with keeping track of the weather. Now he has he's own app! Just need to get him internet now so he can use it...

## The problem

The problem I always struggle with is the start. I have a hard time knowing where to start. 
The next project i will do a better working plan and also have a plan B.

If I had more time I would focus on making it look good in the desktop view... 
And of course learn more about JS and maybe try some red level things.
