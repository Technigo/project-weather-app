# Weather App

The city or The beach, weather forecast
This project was to start working with API's. 

## The problem

I had a lot of issues and this was a difucult project for me since I never worked with a Api before, But I also really enjoyed it. 

I thought the fetch aspect was easy but got some issue later on.
Adding the forecast was hard for me, I look up youtube wideos and check a lot of questions on Stack Overflow. I managed to fix it.

When I added more cities, that messed up my code a lot, the changing color fuction and the forecast did go crazy.
For this once I got help from a developer friend, that is very good a troubleshooting and found the problem right away, I didn't have a stop to the function, it was just contiuning invoking when clicking on new cities. 

Also had major issues with my netlify and github didn't connect, doesn't work for me, I need help with that.

For next weeks I would like to be more active on Stack Overflow.
