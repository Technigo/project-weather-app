# Weather App

The aim of this project was to fetch data from a weather API and implement the data into a website. The weather data includes name of city, rounded temperatures, weather description & images, sunrise and sunset times. 

## The problem
One challenge in this project was to understand the data offered by the API and implement the data into the website. Convertion to local times and temperatures involved. 

Right now, the weather forecast has been based on two time entry points to receive the temperature. To improve the accuracy of the shown data, it would be good to fetch more data.
