# Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

This is a project built in the Technigo bootcamp course, week 6. The objective was to get an introduction on how to fetch data from APIs, get an understanding of the different data types and how to modify that data. 

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.
