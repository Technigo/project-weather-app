# Weather App

Week 6 of the bootcamp at Technigo did include working with APIs and creating a weather-app.

## The problem

I struggled a bit with understanding APIs so I kept this project very simple to understand the concept of APIs. If I had more time I would add a function where the user could search for the weather at any place in the world.
