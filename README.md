# Weather App

In this project we are creating a weather app, with the main focus on getting comfortable working with API's, promises and bransches.

- The app should have: city name, current temperature, weather description, sunrise/sunset time, 4-day forecast.
- The presentation of the data should be in the specified format.
- Be responsive and look good on devices from 320px width up to 1600px.
- Follow one of the provided designs as closely as possible.

## The problem

I started with setting up really simple html with one container, and connecting the main API on master, before splitting up into three branches: ft-sun, ft-forecast and styling. I then worked seperatly on these bransches up until the basic requirements were met and I were ready to publish the first version on Netlify.

I depated whether to render all content via javascript or only the changing value. As a first solution I took this route for the sake of simplicity. However, I might change this before project deadline, and insert each value of the Current Weather seperatly.

I found the styling to be the most challenging part of this project.

As my next step I will take on the stretch goals:

- I will try adding another place, and utilise the meny and "next button" from the design.

- I want to explore how to inset background animations, such as rain.
  -In the design there is a pattern which I haven't figured out how to replicate.
