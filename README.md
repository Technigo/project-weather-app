# Weather App

In this project I've created a weather app which dispalys:
_ name of a city
-Currrent temperature
-Weather type and icon
-sunrise and sunset
- Five days weather forecast

## The problem

I wanted to do clean and short code. I think I managed to e.g display the forecast in just a few lines. However I didn't manage to show icons for the forecast in this way. I commented that out, since I'm still working on it. I haven't had time to fix the searchbox and geolocation yet, which I really want to do, as well as differnet backgrounds depending on the weather. Due to lack of time I haven't completed that yet, but will do later. 
UPDATE: I've fixed the serach input so that users can search by city name.
