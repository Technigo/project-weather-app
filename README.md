# Weather App

This week's project was to build a simple weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. We worked in pairs and started off with mob programming before we split up into branches. 

This weather app was built by Saralie Bognandi and Julia Ã–stedt.

## The problem

We had some issues getting the icons to show properly, we searched online and discussed with our larger team to figure out the problem. Turned out to be an issue with our folders, which was solved by just creating a new folder... :) 

If we had more time we would have wanted to explore using more loops and add more features, such as a search bar and more cities.
