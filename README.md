# Weather App

This app is presenting weather information and forecast for Stockholm, Sweden from the API at https://openweathermap.org/

## The problem

Step one was to create a api key and call for the json data in a fetch promise. Step two was to filter and display this information in the html. Step three was to make a second fetch for a five days forecast. If I had more time I would loop the accurate day for each weekday and I would add more cities to forecast for. This project was dificult to deploy with netlify.
