# Weather App

The assignment was to create a weather app with the help of an API and show the weather for both today and the next 5 days. And to make it responsive. 

## The problem

I used fetch to collect data from the API. 
If I had more time I'd change the colors and the h1-text depending on the weather aswell. And make the dotted line under the 5-day forecast to go from the day to the degrees. If I had had a lot of time I would have added more data.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
