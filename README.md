# Weather App

In week 6 of Technigo Bootcamp our project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, sunsrise & sunset, and a 5-day forecast using an open weather API.

## The problem

In this project I have learned to fecth information from an api and to manipulate it so that it shows in a easy and readable way. 

If i had more time I would try to do some animations in the app and make it catch the location of the user. 


## View it live

Here you can see the app live and what the weather is in Skanör & Falsterbo.
