# Weather App
A weather app for Uppsala Sweden, with three extra locations - London UK, Alicante Spain and Tampa US. The data used for the App is fetched from Open Weather Map.

## The problem
I was supposed to create a weather app with data fetched from Open Weather Map. I used an API key and selected some cities that I'm instreasted in. It was the first time working with API's and it was a bit confusing at the beginning but after some practice it became easier and I manged to reach the data I was intreasted in
