# Weather App

My first API project. It shows the weather in Malm√∂, sunrise+sunset and a 4 day forecast.

## The problem

I'm using two different API:s, one for the weather and one for the forecast. I'm filtering the data and using innerHTML to display the information. I would like to add a search bar so that you could get the weather for other cities as well. But I spent my time making it look cute and colorful instead! :D
