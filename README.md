# Weather App

The project brief was to create a weather app using APIs and to match the design specs provided.

## The problem

We started by mob programming a master branch together. Here we added the basic HTML structure, as well as ID and classnames, and the script.js and style.css files.

After that, we decided on the first 3 features to build and divided into teams.

Wednesday we met and merged all of our features together, and met the minimum requirements.

After that, we decided if anyone had more time or desire to create more branches, that we could do that.

We ended up creating two more branches - one to fix some small styling issues, and one for geolocation.

Friday we met up again, reviewed the code together, refactored and cleaned it up, and merged it.

We planned before the week began by mapping out all of our schedules, so we had an idea of when we were all available.

If we had more time, it would have been fun to add some animation. It would also have been fun to meet up in real life for some mob programming and champagne with caviar on blinis.

Overall, it was a good and challenging experience working in a team. It was useful learning how to work in branches and how to merge. It was also more fun working together - it took some of the pressure off, and made for an enjoyable experience.
