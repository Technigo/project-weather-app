# Weather App

### This project was made as part of Technigo’s front-end developer boot camp Fall 2020. 

This project was to build a simple weather web app which shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem
I started with the fetch functions, getting the API information, making sure all the data was retrieved and printed it in the console. When I had my data in place i put it to display in the html and styled it with CSS. 

## View it live
The site is deployed <a href="https://goofy-tereshkova-df2051.netlify.app">here.</a>  
Check it out and learn keep track of the weather in Longyearbyen!

Some fun facts about Longyearbyen:

*The Norwegian town of Longyearbyen is actually closer to the North Pole than it is to Oslo. The arctic location makes Longyearbyen super-cold throughout the year. And during the winter the town sees long stretches of unbroken darkness. To avoid collapse when the ice beneath them starts melting, all houses in the city are built on stilts. Longyearbyen has 3000 inhabitants and approximately one-third of them are foreigners.

The community has a shockingly low crime rate, partially because of the fact that it’s illegal to live here without a job or a permanent address. Moreover, it’s also illegal to die there, because it’s too cold for bodies to decompose; something that caused a deadly disease outbreak in the past. Gun ownership is unusually high primarily to protect against the threat of polar bears. And the police enforced a law that anyone traveling outside of the city must carry a weapon and know how to use it.*
