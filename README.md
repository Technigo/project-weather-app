# Weather App

Current and forecast weather app with data from an API. Geolocation and different js and CSS animations. 

## The problem

I would totally do a different approach next time. I dig too deep into the syntax and how API and json works. Lost a lot of time with that. 

Neither doing a good layout nor cleaning the code is something that can be done in one day. Lesson learned. Especially if you're a perfectionist like I am. Never being satisfied enough is also something I need to work with.

Conclusion, better time management and structure next time.
