# Weather App

This was a Javascript project at the Technigo bootcamp. The assignment was to build an app using data from an open weather API.

## The problem
I had great help from my mentor to work through the structure of the DOM. In the end I had learned a lot about how Javascript and API:s work, and how to think about the DOM-structure when fetching data from an API.
