# Weather App
The project was to create a weather app, fetching API data using fetch() in JavaScript. The page had to be responsive and working for mobile, tablet and desktop.

I did the blue level.

## The problem
I got really stuck when working on the five day forcast. I tried to look at other peoples code, I asked my team and used Google but I could not apply the code I saw into my own. Then I had a 1:1 with Van who explained step by step how the filter function works, and after that I managed to figure out how to display the five day forecast. This project did take me a lot of time to get done, but I really wanted to make sure I understood what I wrote this time in the JS file. I'm happy now to be able to hand it in and understand what it is I've done. 

I wish I could have figured the code out faster so I could have put more time into styling and maybe red level, but I'm still happy now about getting the blue level done.
