# Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

# Solution ðŸŽ¨

I build an app using API from Open Weather Map. I picked the city which I like, to make it nicer for myself ;) 

The background is changing based on weather, same as the picture and the greeting. Then, there are next five days. I'm still working on making it more user friendly, and show the names of days, not the dates. 

The app is dedicated for phones, maybe for tablets also, but should still looks simple on laptops. 

I feel like this assignment fits me really well, I don't have much struggle, I learned a lot in nice way, and just enjoy coding.
