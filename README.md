# Weather App

This project was made on week 6 for Technigo Bootcamp as an Mobprogramming project (Julia Nikitina, Helena Wiklund, Elsa Carlström, Priscila Alfaro Segura, Efthymios Karakasis).

This week's project was to build a weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API, Basic JSON and fetch() in JavaScript.

## The problem

It was our first experience to work in different branches, so we spent some time to figure out how to use git and merge correctly our features into master.
We got challenged with displaying data in a readable time format and the forecast list array to only get the info from 12:00 each day, but we managed to do it and even display more supplementary information, like wind speed.

We are proud of our styling, especially about changed color theme based on weather conditions. Moreover, an opportunity given to the user to check a couple of other cities.

If we had some more time, we would display cities from other time zones as well and add some CSS animations.
