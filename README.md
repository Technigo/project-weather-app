# Weather App

This week I made a webpage showing weather data fetched from weather API as a project for the Technigo bootcamp.

## The problem

Understanding fetch() and json was quite straightforward. The problem was how to manipulate json into the data format that I wanted to print out.
I got most help from code-alongs where I learned new methods such as new Date() and toLocaleDateString(,{}). Going through material from last week also helped me to understand how to access the object inside an array and how to iterate through an array, using forEach function. 
I was stuck with how to deal with svg icons and how to style the elements to look like a given design asset. I asked question to a teammate and got help, and also posted a question on Slack and got an answer as well.
