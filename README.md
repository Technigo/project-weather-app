# Weather App

The project was to work in pairs and make a weather-app. We worked witch javascript, fetching api, getting the data from the fetched json and modifing the dom. We learned about the Date function and different ways of formatting the date. We also learned about working on branches on git.

The app loads the coordinates based on the geolocation and shows the current weather details in the top half of the page (city, current temperature, weather type and sunrise and sunset). If the location service are turned off on the user's computer it will show Stockholm by default.
The forecast shows the average temperature for the next 5 days at 9am each day.
The background changes based on the weather type.

## The problem

We approached the task by discussing which design we would want to use and then together in a live share we set up the basic html structure including classes and fetched all the necessary data.
Further things to improve: A dropdown can be added that includes the city names, so that the user can change their location.
