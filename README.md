# Weather App

We had to build a weather app by fetching data from an API. Design wise we should follow a fixed template.

## The problem

I started with setting up a basic HTML. After that I worked on getting all the data from the API. Then there was the big styling part. It will change depending on the weather.
If I would have more time I would add a search bar where a user can search a city because currently the city is fixed.
