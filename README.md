# Weather App

This was a project I did while attending Technigos 24 week frontend program. The challange was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. The purpose was to learn what an API is and how to use it, to understand basic JSON and how to use `fetch()` and promises in JavaScript.

## The problem

It is really challenging trying to wrap my head around the concept of promises in Javascript, but I hope it clears sometime ahead. Right know it feels like I copied the teachers code from the instruction film but I donÂ´t really understand how it works. If I had more time and energy (because my energy level was very low this week) I would of gone for the stretch goals and done more styling.
