# Weather App

This project was about fetching weather information from an API, creating an app based on a provided design and adding different features while working in branches.

## The problem

I started by laying out the foundation as per the instruction. I created a basic HTML structure, gave the app some basic styling in accordance with the provided design. When it was time to add more features, I started working in branches. Here I made a mistake, as whenever I was done with a feature, I accidentially made a branch out of that branch, and so on. I think I did that due to lack of understanding how github works - I kind of thought that when creating a new branch, it will be based on the main file. So when it was time to merge, I only had to merge the last branch cause it already had all the commits from the previous branches. Anyway I learned a lot from that mistake.

There is a bug that I don't have time to solve before submitting. In the evening, the app shows forecast of 4 days instead of 5, the day of "tomorrow" disappears. There is an issue with when the program considers a new day starting. Anyway I will solve that at a later point.

If I had more time, I would create the feature where you can toggle between showing the forecast and hiding it.
