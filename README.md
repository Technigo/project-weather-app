# Weather App

The aim of this project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

First I focused on the main objective of getting the app to fetch the weather info for today's weather and the 5-day forecast. After I managed to get all the information I wanted to be displayed in the app, I focused on styling the app depending on the weather. I also decided to add animations for each weather type. After I had gotten the app to look as desired, I focused on making it more responsive and interactive. I wanted a potential user to be able to choose which city they wanted to see the weather for, why I created a search function which gets the weather info of a chosen city from the API. 

If I had more time, I would change the default city (Stockholm) to the users location. I also think the styling for larger screens could be more fun.
