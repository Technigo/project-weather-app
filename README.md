# Weather App

This project was a part of the Technigo coding bootcamp. The assignment was to create a weather app that fetched data from an API and showed todays' weather and a five day forecast.

## The problem

This was the first assignment where I fetched data from an API and to find and show that data in a correct and user friendly way was the main challenge. Apart from the app showing different temperatures and weather conditions the icons and background also changes depending on the forecast.
