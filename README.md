This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

**_Design_**

I used design 2 as inspiration in layout, colors and fonts.

I changed the colors of a section based on the weather and added a message about what you can do. [background gradient.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)
