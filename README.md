# Weather App

This weeks assignment was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API from openweathermap.org. 

## The problem

Firstly I searched for icons and started out with the variables for the key and url. After that I proceeded to fetch the data for the current weather in Jönköping. I got stuck in trying to get the app to show multiple cities, so I went back to showing only one city in the end. I will try to make the app more flexible with some kind of search-function when I have the time.  

After fetching data for current weather and displaying it on the html-page  I went back to the weather forecast. This was a challenge because I hadn't really decided beforehand on how I wanted to display the data. Filtering the list-array made things easier and I'm happy with the result!
