# Build a Weather Web App

Week 6 of Technigo's Bootcamp

This week's project was to build and design a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make an app showing the weather in Stockholm today and a 5 day forecast.

# Design

The design was up to me. To make it more personal I made my own illustrations that changes with the weather and sunrise/sunset.
