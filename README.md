`PROJECT 6`

# Build a Weather Dashboard :sunny:

This weeks project is to build a simple weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature using a weather API. We will start by keeping it simple and then there's great possibilities to build on with stretch goals. The page, before stretch goals should look something along the lines of this:

**_Design_**

Change the colors of the page based on the weather. If the weather is warm – use warm colors. If the weather is colder, use cold colors. If you really want to push you CSS muscles you can even make a [background gradient.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)
