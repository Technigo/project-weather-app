# Weather App

This week's project was to build a weather app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

This week I knew I would have limited time due to work and family so I aimed for the blue level.
I spent the most time on time formats this week. I also struggled a bit with getting the forecast image into the right place.

I tried to make a hidden search function to make it possible to change the weather loacation. I didn't have time to complete this but left some of the code for this because I would like to finish it another time.
