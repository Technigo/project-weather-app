# Weather App

Through mob-programming (4 person group) this project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. 

## The problem

In this project we got to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In JavaScript we used Basic JSON, fetch(), promises and how to work with the Date() object in JavaScript. 

We started to work with the project as a group mob-programming, then we branched our project into two branches (to make two different features; sunrise and sunset through pair-programming). Then we merged both branches into our master again and finalised the styling as a group. 
We got a step by step “instruction” on what to tackle first, so in that sense we didn’t plan that much. Later on when we started with the styling we made a visual sketch to put everyone on the same page. 

If we had more time, or if we got to do the project again we would make a plan with assigned time slots when to solve certain features, and then ask for external help instead of spending too much time on each part.
