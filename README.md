# Weather App

This is the front end boot camp assignment number 6 creating a weather app by fetching data from an API. Part of the practice was also to implement a given design layout. This project was done as a pair-programming assignment.  

## The problem

We have created our code entirely from scratch. We started out by analysing the brief in general, and getting ourselves going with the actual fetch from the weather API in JavaScript. After that we worked our way through the project by creating all necessary functions alongside the general structure of the HTML. It was a lot of fun doing our very first fetch!

The second part of the assignment was so try to do a design replica of a given design sketch. We really embraced this part of the project as a good practice for upcoming projects working as front end developers in the future, being given a set design to put to life. Some of the features have been modified by us, as modest suggestion for improvement from a user perspective.

If we had more time would have liked for the weekdays to be printed in full (e.g "Monday" instead of "Mon"). The website is responsive to various devices, but we would like to fine tune the layouts in Tablet and Desktop view. It would also be fun to add forecasts for additional cities.
