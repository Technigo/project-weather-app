# Weather App
### Week 3 Technigo Bootcamp

This was my first week trying out pair programming with Joanna Philips. Together we made a weather app using HTML, CSS and JS. Our goal was to display the weather in stockholm, tokyo and our home towns using information retrieved from an API.


## The problem
This week was all about learning about API's, how to use git branching and merging in conjuction with pair programming, reading basic JSON, how to use ```fetch``` and promises in Javascript, and how to work with the ```date``` object. 
<br>
First we wrote the basic HTML document to display the weather, sunset sunrise and weather description of stockholm then we added the additional cities and 5 day forcast. The we branched the project and seperately worked on sections of the weather app after which we merged the changes and finished the CSS styling together.
