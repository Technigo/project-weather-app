# Weather App
A weather app for Uppsala Sweden, with three extra locations - London UK, Alicante Spain and Tampa US. The data used for the App is fetched from Open Weather Map.

## The problem
I was supposed to create a weather app with data fetched from Open Weather Map. I used an API key and selected some cities that I'm instreasted in. It was the first time working with API's and it was a bit confusing at the beginning but after some practice it became easier and I manged to reach the data I was intreasted in. I struggled with getting the date format that I wanted, and I spend quite some time searching on the internet and discussing it with my team mates. At the end, we got the information about this at the lecture, and after that, the problem was easy to solve.  My next step would be to make the other cities forecast in an accordion.
