# Weather Web App :sunny:

In this project I created a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

## In this project, you will find:

- API and basic JSON
- use of fetch(), promises and Date() object in JavaScript

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning 🔨

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the weather app. The page works on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop.

## Deployed version 🚀
