# Weather App

Building a weather app by using fetch requests and external APIs. We decided to go for Design 2 of the two ones that was provided. 

## The problem

We struggled with merging our branches into the master. Managed to find a solution by reverting our changes and redo the merge. 

If we would've had more time, we would refactor the code to decrease the lines of code.
