# Weather App

Technigo bootcamp. The task was to build an weather page with a open API.

## The problem

Got the information from a API with fetch. 
I had problem with the stylig, couldn't get the background for the whole webpage. 
If I had more time I would definitely fix that. 

Also if I had more time I would add more styling and more information from the API.
