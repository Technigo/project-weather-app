# Weather App

In this assignment we got the task to make a weather site that would update the current weather in chosen city using API's. 


## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We started by going through all of the current week's Technigo lessons and then started doing the team codesandbox-exercises together, practicing fetching different information from API's. Then we started with our mob programming, setting up the basic HTML-structure and connecting it with our JS and CSS. After that we started with our fetch request with guidance from this week's material, code from other weather apps and stack overflow. It was going smoothly and we had a lot of fun when we were mob-programming and got our fetches and javascript to work. We then split up into branches and started to work on different features. We thought that we were ahead in our progress and had plans to make a search form to input different cities but when we were merging our branches we ran into a lot of trouble with git. We tried to ask for help and search on stackOverflow and tried a bunch of suggestions but it didn't work so eventually we had to work around the problem and copy our code manually to get it all in one place. We also had issues deploying on netlify with no clue why. Hope we can get some clarity next week to be able to solve situations like this better in the future.

If we had more time we would add a search bar for different cities, I think we will try to add that at some point when we can.
