# Weather App

Simple weather web app, where you can see the weather live for 6 different cities as well as their 5-day forecast. Pair project made by Camilla Cronqvist and Sofia Gerdmar.

## The problem

The weather fetches info from a free weather API. Focus was on working with API's. The web app is built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. There are two different conditionals which changes the design of the app depending on the current weather in a city. One conditional sets the background color depending on the temperature, and the other conditional changes the weather icon depending on the description for the current weather. The web app is responsive and built with CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox.
