# Weather App

This weather app was designed to display current weather and the weather of next four days at a certain place.
User can either share their location to get the accurate weather of the place they live in or they can search for the place to check the weather.

## The problem

I approached the problem by first reading through the API documentations in order to understand how the data is formatted. Then I start building on functions in JavaScript to format the data in accordance with the design and instruction. Moving on, I worked on the CSS and HTML to style the website and make it user-friendy and in line with the instruction. Finally, I focused on making JavaScript promise-based functions chained together logically.

If I have more time, I would make the search bar responsive, like applying some hover effect. Also, I would maybe create a field on website for displaying the error message and also dig deeper into the field of catching all kinds of errors.
