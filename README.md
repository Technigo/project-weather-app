# Weather App

to build a simple weather dashboard that uses a weather API to tell today's weather and temperature and a 4-day forecast. We also had to make the design as similar as possible to the ones that were provided

## The problem

I followed the steps from the past live sessions and from youtube, I had problems with the styling trying to make it as similar as possible, and displaying the sunset/sunrise in a correct format.

If I had more time I would like to make the live-time work correctly, and add the option to see other cities weather, also improve more the design
