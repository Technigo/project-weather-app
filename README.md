# Weather App
This weeks project was to build a weather site using fetch and also using a oublic API.

## The problem
I found this week extremely difficult. Since I have never coded before I believe I would have needed something more to hold on to.
I managed to get the weather for Stockholm to work, unless the sunrise and sunset, but when I tried to fetch the 5-day forecast nothing worked.
I tried asking questions but still don't understand this project. So I have had a hard week feeling really stuck and as you will see haven't managed to solve all the steps as required.
