# Weather App

We made a weather app using HTML, CSS and JS. Our goal was to display the weather in stockholm using information retrieved from an API.
Our API
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Stockholm,Sweden&units=metric&APPID=0885d110db76ae5dbaae0c2672772fdf

## The problem
We worked in pairs this time. First we made our API and wrote the basic HTML document, then we did the basic Javascript for the main weather display of stockholm. The we did a feature freeze and seperately worked on sections of the weather app after which we merged the changes and finished the CSS together.
