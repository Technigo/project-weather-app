# Weather App

We created a responsive weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/). It was done working in pairs and working with branches on Github.

## The problem

We used mostly JavaScript for this project. We planned it together and worked separately on some of the feature branches. Towards the end we used pair programming and liveshare in VS Code.
If we had more time we would add more fuctionality to the navigation bar, make the code cleaner and repeat less.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
