# Weather App

This project helped me learn how to fetch data from API and display it in
a weather app.

## The problem

For this project I chose one of the giving designs and tried to make the app look as close to is as possible. I am proud of creating the structure of the page and Javascript logic from scratch.
I managed to resolve several issues:
-Displaying sunset/sunrise times in a readable way
-Making the design change according to the weather conditions
-Adding an option to choose a city

Technologies used:
-Javascript
-CSS
-HTMLS

## Project 5: Weather App
This project is a weather app fetching and displaying data from a weather api.For this project I used a ready design and tried to make the app look as close to is as possible. The screen design changes accordingly to the weather conditions. There is also an option to change the location using a dropdown menu. 

## The process

1. Fetch and display data from the api.
2. Set sunrise/sunset times
3. Add a dropdown menu with locations.
4. Style the app. 
5. Created a function allowing the design to change according to the weather conditions.

## Focus
