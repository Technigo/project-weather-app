# Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

Link to my project: https://weather-app-linda.netlify.com/

This week's project we have built a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

Stretch goals:
I have included a section with Geolocation and the background color will change depending if it's night or day.



## What we have learnt ðŸ§ 

- What an API is and how to use it
- Basic JSON
- How to use fetch() in Javascript
- How to use promises in JavaScript

## Requirements ðŸ§ª

- You should fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript
- All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API
- The presentation of the data should be in the specified format.
- The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)-
