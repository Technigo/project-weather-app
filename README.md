# WEATHER APP
Created by Jacob Lie, Hanna Nörgård and Niclas Jensen

This weather app displays today's forecast as well as the five-day forecast for any city entered in the search field. Built with Javascript, it fetches the OpenWeather API to display the weather data for any given city.

## THE PROJECT

Working individually, in pairs and finally as a group, we created an HTML skeleton before moving on to the CSS & Javascript portions of the project. We continued adding new features following every successful iteration of the app until we ran out of time.

The learning goals included the following:

Working with branches on GitHub
What an API is and how to use it
Basic JSON
How to use `fetch()` in JavaScript
How to use promises in JavaScript
How to work with the `Date()` object in JavaScript

If we had had more time, we would have implemented more CSS effects that would trigger depending on the weather of the selected city (snowflakes, rain, etc.)

## VIEW IT LIVE

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
