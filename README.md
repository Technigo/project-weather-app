# Weather App

This week we created the weather app according to a set up design. We manage to include a searchbar and a geolocation feature.

## The problem

As a team we first started together with getting used to the API and how to use it and the we divided tasks. When there was a problem we talked about it and figure out how to solve it together. We checked Slack Overflow for past answers. If we had more time we would like to add the current location as part of the searchbar.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
