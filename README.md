# Weather App

This project was an introduction to APIs and using fetch function in JavaScript to get data from APIs and use the data and present the data in a weather forecast app. Also formatting dates in JavaScript was introduced.

## The problem

I started with getting an API key and used two APIs: one for current weather and one for forecast for five days. Then I tested that I could extract the data of the APIs and once I did that I assigned them to variables and injected the data to different HTML elements. In some cases I added the HTML elements in JavaScript. After having obtained the data necessary for current weather and the five-day forecast I styled the site and used media queries in CSS to make it responsive. If I had more time I would have added more cities and also changed background according to weather. I would have also tried to  figure out how the user could type in a city or use geolocation to get the weather of that place.
