# Weather app

A simple weather app that displays the current weather and a 5 day forecast for Stockholm. One of my projects during Technigo frontend boot camp.

## What did I do?

I started this project with looking at what kind of data I could get from the open weather API. Then I made sure that I could fetch the data and display it.

I made a simple sketch of the structure and created a mobile first site.

In this project I used fetch to get data from the API, basic JSON, Javscript, HTML and CSS. I used grid for the layout.

If i had more time I would probably use an accordion for the 5 day forecast.
