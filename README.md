# Weather App

Creating a weather app using the API from openweathermap.org and trying to replicate one of the two designs given from Technigo.

## The problem

First problem that came, was the implementation of the API in the JS script. The documentation were provided, but it was still not clear to me what I have to do to make it work.
After I understood what I had to do, I pretty fast made the today's weather. This gave me a confidance boost. I thought this project is going to be easy, until I had to display the forecast. My problem here was at first to filter the data to just display four das and not every single data point. Next I had some issues displaying the lowest and highest temperature for the forecast. Either it showed for all four days the same temperature or I only got one day right and the rest was "Infinity° / -Infinity°C.

I definitely didn't go for the stretch goals, even though I wanted. If I had more time, I might have done more.
