# Weather App

A small weather dashboard based on OpenWeather. The dashboard is showing the current weather in Stockholm and a forecast for five days.

## The problem

The project is mainly done in javascript and css. Two separate api endpoints are used, one to display the details of the current weather and one used for the forcast. If/else if statements are used to select icons and backgrounds based in the weather description from json. Grid is the main layout system used to structure the elements in css. Two media queries are used to make the site responsive, and one media query is used to enable dark mode based on the user's device setting. 

If I had more time I would like to change so that the user can either choose between different cities or make it so that the forecast is automatically updated based on the users location.
