# Weather App

The goal of this project was to create a weather app using APIs.

## The problem

The biggest challenges in this project were the hamburger menu (getting it to display nicely while not interfering with the other elements) and getting the min/max temperatures from the API. As we chose to implement one of the suggested designs, we also had some difficulties with that, mostly because of missing images and missing design for tablet/desktop.
