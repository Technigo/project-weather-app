Weather App ‚õÖÔ∏è
This project is a weather web app using the Open Weather API that shows current weather and a five day forecast. The main section has city name, temperature, weather icon, a small discription of the weather as well as, sunrise and sunset times.

Bellow there's a five day forecast section which shows the minimum and maximum temperatures for each respective day.

It is responsive, all versions display the same information, however destop version has a slightly different contained design and then a second version optimised for mobile and tablets.

Planning & The problem üß©
I started this project by extracting all the data I needed from the Open Weather API's using fetch(), there was a lot to learn since I'm using API's for the very first time! Then I coded my way into displaying it all in a blank page and then did the styling, which was really interesting as I learned to inject items directly from javascript.

I ran into a problem while dealing with the min and max temperatures for the 5 day forecast since it has a 3 hour interval and choosing a specific hour in the middle of the day would bring too little variation, but I managed to deal with it in a way that will compare the temperatures and display the lowest temperature for the day and do the same for the highest. I learned a lot about how to fetch data, how to deal and display that data and a lot about taking information from specific items and compare them
